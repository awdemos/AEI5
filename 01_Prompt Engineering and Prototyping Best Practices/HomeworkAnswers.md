   Aspect Tested:
   1. Ability to solve the math problem.
   2. Correctness of the answer.
   3. Providing correct thought process and reasoning behind the answer.
   4. Able to repeat the answer on multiple tries.

   Vibe Check: <br/> I checked the answer with a Perplexity pro search "Yes, the solution shown in the image is correct. Let me verify each calculation:

   For apples:
   - Need 12 apples total
   - Each pack contains 4 apples
   - $$12 √∑ 4 = 3$$ packs needed[4]

   For oranges:
   - Need 9 oranges total
   - Each pack contains 3 oranges
   - $$9 √∑ 3 = 3$$ packs needed[5]

   Therefore, the answer of 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges is mathematically correct and will provide exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool? <br/>

Some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool is the lack of sample data one can produce manually and so the analyst will have to use guesswork to determine how the model performs. Without extensive testing of the model its real strengths and weaknesses will be in gen-z dialect, "will be hella sketchy."
Vibe checks are good tho, it lets me know the system is working a bit like running the ls command.
